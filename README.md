## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Alpha-Motivational-Webapp.git
   cd Alpha-Motivational-Webapp
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the FastAPI application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

## File Structure

- `main.py`: FastAPI application with the motivational message generator.
- `demo.html`: HTML template for the user input form.
- `requirements.txt`: List of project dependencies.
- `test_models.py`: Script to list available OpenAI GPT models (run this to see options and manually update the model name in `main.py` if needed).

## Model Configuration

- To check available GPT models, run:
  ```bash
  python test_models.py
  ```
  This will display the total number of models and their IDs. If you want to change the model (currently set to `gpt-4o` in `main.py`), manually update the `model` parameter in the `get_motivational_message` function to your preferred model ID (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`).
